# Knowledge Management Systems

## What is a Knowledge Management System?

A knowledge management system is a very simple thing: it is simply a system for keeping track of your knowledge.

More than that, it can also contain things like:

- Basic note-taking
- Todo list
- Documentation
- Reports and papers that you are working on
- Your blog
  Basically, anything you can think of.

## Top-Down Or Bottom-Up

A **top-down** approach is where you have predefined categories and you put your knowledge into those categories. E.g. you have a category for `Python` and you put all your Python knowledge into that category, or on your computer you have a folder called `Python` and you put all your Python knowledge into that folder.

A **bottom-up** approach is where you have no predefined categories and you just put your knowledge into the system and then you can search for it later. E.g. you have a folder called `Knowledge` and you put all your knowledge into that folder, and then you can search for it later. Example of bottom-up system are based on `tags`

## Build Your Own Or Use A Ready-Made System

You can find a long list of ready-made systems out there, just to name a few:

Notion
Logseq
Zotero
Obsidian
Evernote
OneNote
VimWiki
OrgMode
Some of these are free, some have free tiers, and some are commercial.

These products all have their pros and cons, but you may be able to find a system that suits your needs.

Alternatively, you could build your own.

## Things To Consider For Your Knowledge Management System

There are a number of things you might want to consider before making your choice:

- Am I in control of my data, e.g., can I easily move my data to another system
- Are my data secure
- Can I access my data from a mobile device
- Can I backup and keep change log on my data
- Can I access my data from my favorite text editor
- Can I extend the system to meet special needs
- How quickly can I access my data
- How effectively and efficiently can I search my data
