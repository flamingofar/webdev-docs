# Continuous Integration

Enviroment virable as RTE is short for Run Time Enviroment. This can be set to either `dev` or `prod` depending on the enviroment you are running the application in. This is used to determine which database to connect to for example.

## Registry

A registry is a place to store docker images. Dockerhub is a public registry that can be used to store images. You can also create your own private registry to store images. This is useful if you want to keep your images private. At GitLab we have our own private registry that we use to store our images.
