# Misc. Notes

## Alpine Linux

When choosing Alpine you must know that it uses musl libc instead of glibc. This means that you will not be able to use binaries that are linked against glibc.

It lacks build tools by default, so you will need to install them.

It is the most lightweight of the three, but it is not as widely used as the other two.

## bin/sh

This points to the standard shell on the system. It is not always bash zsh or other.

## Docker Notes

When building your docker image we will use --pull to make sure we are using the latest version of the base image and use the cache if available, because Docker is not persisting the cache between builds.
